## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

With these css property below, outline and border, i now know how to make the button outline gone. This is actually my first time using both of property and it is really helping me and i'm proud i can find them useful.

```html
<h1>Some code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
section .buttons .cancel {
  ......
  outline: none;
  border: none;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this bootstrap and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
